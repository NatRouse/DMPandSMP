# DMPandSMP
Iterations of dynamic movement primitive (DMP) &amp; SHC-based movement primitive (SMP) comparison scripts. SMP framework based on Lotka-Volterra equations.

###### Check master branch for ICRA & RA-L submission code.
This branch is focused on implementing different learning algorithms & integrating dynamics into the system. The system currently uses a batch learning method & operates kinematically only. The most relevant files are the SMPviz#.m files.
